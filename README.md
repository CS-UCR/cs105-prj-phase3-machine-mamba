# Project Phase 1 - Data Collection and Data Cleaning
In this particular phase. I did not deem it necessary to gather anymore data. The reason being was because I pulled my data directly from kaggle.com. More specifically from https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba#nba_2017_salary.csv. 

These datasets included (not all):
- nba_2017_attendance.csv
  - NBA Team attendance (total number of attendance over the course of 1 season & average game attendance) 
- nba_2017team_valuations.csv
  - NBA team valuations (*based on millions)


# Project Phase 2 - Data Cleaning and EDA
TBD. 



# Project Phase 3 - Data Analysis Phase
TBD.
