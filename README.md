# CS 105 - Final Project 
## Machine Mamba 


# Project Phase 1 - Data Collection and Data Cleaning
In this particular phase. I did not deem it necessary to gather anymore data. The reason being was because I pulled my data directly from kaggle.com. More specifically from https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba#nba_2017_salary.csv. 

These datasets included (not all):
- twitter_players.csv
  - Based on Top NBA Player Twitter followings. 
- team_valuations.csv
  - NBA team valuations (*based on billions)
- shot_logs.csv
  - NBA Player shot logs of every game from the NBA 2016 - 2017 season. 


# Project Phase 2 - Data Cleaning and EDA
TBD.
