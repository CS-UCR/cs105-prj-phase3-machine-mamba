# Project Phase 1 - Data Collection and Data Cleaning
In this particular phase. I did not deem it necessary to gather anymore data. The reason being was because I pulled my data directly from kaggle.com. More specifically from https://www.kaggle.com/noahgift/social-power-nba#nba_2017_salary.csv. 

These datasets included (not all):
- nba_2017_attendance.csv
  - NBA Team attendance (total number of attendance over the course of 1 season & average game attendance) 
- nba_2017team_valuations.csv
  - NBA team valuations (*based on millions)
- Team_Records.csv
  - Team W/L percentage


# Project Phase 2 - Data Cleaning and EDA
The process of cleaning the data was not difficult in my case due to the relative precleaning of data found on kaggle. However making sure to look through various data sets in order to paint a better story was necessary. 

EDA included taking a look a various trends, interesting information, as well as in depth analaysis of several datasets. 

- NBA Team Attendance vs Valuation 
- NBA Teams with the highest average player salaries and valuations


# Project Phase 3 - Data Analysis Phase
TBD.
